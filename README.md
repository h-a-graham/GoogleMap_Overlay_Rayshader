# GoogleMap_Overlay_Rayshader
A quick method for overlaying a Google Map satellite image on a  3D DEM using rayshader and ggmap packages.

## note:
You'll need to download the height data from a source of your choice then play with the zoom settings in the ggmap 'get_googlemap' function to choose the extent of your choice...
